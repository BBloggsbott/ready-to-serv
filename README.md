# ready-to-serv

A backend server for people who don't want to write backend code. Watch this repo for updates.

**Under Initial Development**<br>
Initial Development expected to be completed by 12th October 2020. Initial development involves migration from [BBloggsbott/ProfileServer](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/ProfileServer) which was a Proof of Concept for this.

This repository accepts PRs only from users who have already made commits to the `develop` branch. It will remain the same after the completion of the initial development. Instead, a clone of this repository will be created (to be linked here after completion of initial development). This **clone repo will accept PRs from all users**. This is done in an **attempt to control spam PRs due to Hacktoberfest in the main repo**. After Hacktober is completed, all the changes made in the clone repo by the Opensource community will be pulled into this main repository and the clone will be archived.
